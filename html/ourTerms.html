                <h1>EVE onlin - Terms & service</h1>
                <div class="termText">
                    <p>As an Eve Online subscriber, you must observe and abide by the rules of conduct and policies outlined below, as well as the End User License Agreement. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in the immediate termination of your account and you will forfeit all unused access time to the game. No refunds will be given.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>You may not abuse, harass or threaten another player or authorized representative of CCP, including customer service personnel and volunteers. 
                            This includes, but is not limited to: filing support tickets with false information in an attempt to gain from it or have someone else suffer from it; sending excessive e-mails, 
                            EVE-mails or support tickets; obstructing CCP Employees from doing their jobs; refusal to follow the instructions of a CCP Employee; or implying favoritism by a CCP Employee.</li>
                        
                        <li>You may not use any abusive, defamatory, ethnically or racially offensive, harassing, harmful, hateful, obscene, offensive, sexually explicit, threatening or vulgar language. 
                            (Alternate spelling or partial masking of such words will be reprimanded in the same manner as the actual use of such words.)</li>
                        
                        <li>You may not organize nor be a member of any corporation or group within EVE Online that is based on or advocates any anti-ethnic, anti-gay, anti-religious, racist, sexist or other hate-mongering philosophies</li>
                        
                        <li>You may not use “role-playing” as an excuse to violate these rules. 
                            While EVE Online is a persistent world, fantasy role-playing game, the claim of role-playing is not an acceptable defense for anti-social behavior. 
                            Role-playing is encouraged, but not at the expense of other player. You may not create or participate in a corporation or group that habitually violates this policy.</li>
                        
                        <li>You will report out-of-game issues regarding harassment, such as threatening phone calls or correspondence, to your local law enforcement officials or Internet provider. 
                            CCP will not reveal personal information about its subscribers to unauthorized individuals. We are not responsible for actions taken by our subscribers that occur outside the jurisdiction of our game servers or web site.</li>
                        
                        <li>You will follow the instructions of authorized personnel while in the EVE Online game world or using the EVE Online web site.</li>
                        
                        <li>You may not violate any local, state, national or international laws or regulations.</li>
                        
                        <li>You may not impersonate or present yourself to be a representative of CCP or an EVE Online volunteer. 
                            You may not impersonate or falsely present yourself to be a representative of another player, group of players, character or NPC entity.</li>
                        
                        <li>You may not advertise, employ, market, or promote any form of solicitation – including pyramid schemes and chain letters – in the EVE Online game world or on the website.</li>
                        
                        <li>You may not market, sell, advertise, promote, solicit or otherwise arrange for the exchange or transfer of items in the game or other game services unless it is for in-game sales of in-game services or items.</li>
                        
                        <li>The advertisement or sale of out of game goods and services not directly related to EVE Online is prohibited. 
                            The only out of game goods and services which can be advertised or sold for in-game currency or assets are the following: EVE forum signature creation, EVE related websites, EVE related artwork, third party voice communication server hosting, or EVE Time Codes.</li>
                        
                        <li>You may not arrange for the exchange or transfer of any illegal or pirated software or other contraband while you are using the EVE Online client, servers or website.</li>
                        
                        <li>You may not transmit or upload through the EVE Online client, server or website any copyrighted material that you do not own all rights to without the express written permission of the author or copyright holder.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>CCP MAY FIND IT NECESSARY ON OCCASION TO MAKE CHANGES TO OR RESET CERTAIN PARAMETERS OF THE PERSISTENT GAME WORLD MECHANICS, INTERFACE OR FEATURES OF EVE ONLINE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN GAME BALANCE AND ENHANCE PLAYABILITY OR PERFORMANCE FOR ITS SUBSCRIBERS. THESE CHANGES MAY AFFECT OR CAUSE SETBACKS FOR THE CHARACTERS YOU’VE CREATED.</p>
                    
                    <p>THESE RULES MAY BE REVISED AT ANY TIME. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REVIEW THEM OCCASIONALLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULES, POLICIES AND AGREEMENTS DESIGNATED BY CCP.</p>
